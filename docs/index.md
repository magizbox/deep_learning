# Deep Learning Tutorial <sup><i><a href="http://magizbox.com/">by MG</a></i></sup>

> **Deep learning** (also known as deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with multiple processing layers, composed of multiple linear and non-linear transformations.
