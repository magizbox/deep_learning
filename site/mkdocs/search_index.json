            "text": "Nutch\n\n\n\n  \nHighly extensible, highly scalable Web crawler \n1\n Nutch is a well matured, production ready Web crawler. Nutch 1.x enables fine grained configuration, relying on Apache Hadoop\u2122 data structures, which are great for batch processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\nUsecases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n Features \n1\n \n\n\n\n1\n Transparency\n Nutch is open source, so anyone can see how the ranking algorithms work. With commercial search engines, the precise details of the algorithms are secret so you can never know why a particular search result is ranked as it is. Furthermore, some search engines allow rankings to be based on payments, rather than on the relevance of the site's contents. Nutch is a good fit for academic and government organizations, where the perception of fairness of rankings may be more important.\n\n\n\n2\n Understanding\n We don't have the source code to Google, so Nutch is probably the best we have. It's interesting to see how a large search engine works. Nutch has been built using ideas from academia and industry: for instance, core parts of Nutch are currently being re-implemented to use the \nMapReduce\n.\n\n\n\nMap Reduce distributed processing model, which emerged from Google Labs last year. And Nutch is attractive for researchers who want to try out new search algorithms, since it is so easy to extend.\n\n\n\n3\n Extensibility\n Don't like the way other search engines display their results? Write your own search engine--using Nutch! Nutch is very flexible: it can be customized and incorporated into your application. For developers, Nutch is a great platform for adding search to heterogeneous collections of information, and being able to customize the search interface, or extend the out-of-the-box functionality through the plugin mechanism. For example, you can integrate it into your site to add a search capability.\n\n\n\n2\n Architectures \n2\n \n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Structures \n4\n\n\n\nThe web database\n is a specialized persistent data structure for mirroring the structure and properties of the web graph being crawled. It persists as long as the web graph that is being crawled (and re-crawled) exists, which may be months or years. The WebDB is used only by the crawler and does not play any role during searching. The WebDB stores two types of entities: pages and links.\n\n\n\nA page\n represents a page on the Web, and is indexed by its URL and the MD5 hash of its contents. Other pertinent information is stored, too, including\n\n\n\n\n\nthe number of links in the page (also called outlinks);\n\n\nfetch information (such as when the page is due to be refetched);\n\n\nthe page's score, which is a measure of how important the page is (for example, one measure of importance awards high scores to pages that are linked to from many other pages).\n\n\n\n\n\nA link\n represents a link from one web page (the source) to another (the target). In the WebDB web graph, the nodes are pages and the edges are links.\n\n\n\nA segment\n is a collection of pages fetched and indexed by the crawler in a single run. The fetchlist for a segment is a list of URLs for the crawler to fetch, and is generated from the WebDB. The fetcher output is the data retrieved from the pages in the fetchlist. The fetcher output for the segment is indexed and the index is stored in the segment. Any given segment has a limited lifespan, since it is obsolete as soon as all of its pages have been re-crawled. The default re-fetch interval is 30 days, so it is usually a good idea to delete segments older than this, particularly as they take up so much disk space. Segments are named by the date and time they were created, so it's easy to tell how old they are.\n\n\n\nThe index\n is the inverted index of all of the pages the system has retrieved, and is created by merging all of the individual segment indexes. Nutch uses Lucene for its indexing, so all of the Lucene tools and APIs are available to interact with the generated index. Since this has the potential to cause confusion, it is worth mentioning that the Lucene index format has a concept of segments, too, and these are different from Nutch segments. A Lucene segment is a portion of a Lucene index, whereas a Nutch segment is a fetched and indexed portion of the WebDB.\n\n\n\nView \ngora-hbase-mapping.xml\n for more details\n\n\n\nProcess \n5\n\n\n\n0\n initialize CrawlDb, inject \nseed\n URLs Repeat \ngenerate-fetch-update\n cycle n times:\n\n\n\n1\n The \nInjector\n takes all the URLs of the nutch.txt file and adds them to the \nCrawlDB\n. As a central part of Nutch, the \nCrawlDB\n maintains information on all known URLs (fetch schedule, fetch status, metadata, \u2026).\n\n\n\n2\n Based on the data of \nCrawlDB\n, the \nGenerator\n creates a fetchlist and places it in a newly created \nSegment directory\n.\n\n\n\n3\n Next, the \nFetcher\n gets the content of the URLs on the fetchlist and writes it back to the \nSegment directory\n. This step usually is the most time-consuming one.\n\n\n\n4\n Now the \nParser\n processes the content of each web page and for example omits all html tags. If the crawl functions as an update or an extension to an already existing one (e.g. depth of 3), the \nUpdater\n would add the new data to the \nCrawlDB\n as a next step.\n\n\n\n5\n Before indexing, all the links need to be inverted by \nLink Inverter\n, which takes into account that not the number of outgoing links of a web page is of interest, but rather the number of inbound links. This is quite similar to how Google PageRank works and is important for the scoring function. The inverted links are saved in the \nLinkdb\n.\n\n\n\n6-7.\n Using data from all possible sources (\nCrawlDB\n, \nLinkDB\n and \nSegments\n), the \nIndexer\n creates an index and saves it within the Solr directory. For indexing, the popular Lucene library is used. Now, the user can search for information regarding the crawled web pages via Solr.\n\n\n\n3\n Install Nutch \n6\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\nRequire\n\n\n\n1\n OpenJDK 7 \n ant\n\n\n\n2\n Nutch 2.3 RC (yes, you need 2.3, 2.2 will not work)\n\n\n\n[code lang=\"shell\"]\nwget https://archive.apache.org/dist/nutch/2.3/apache-nutch-2.3-src.tar.gz\ntar -xzf apache-nutch-2.3-src.tar.gz\n[/code]\n\n\n3\n HBase 0.94.27 (HBase 0.98 won't work)\n\n\n\n[code lang=\"shell\"]\nwget https://www.apache.org/dist/hbase/hbase-0.94.27/hbase-0.94.27.tar.gz\ntar -xzf hbase-0.94.27.tar.gz\n[/code]\n\n\n4\n ElasticSearch 1.7\n\n\n\n[code lang=\"sh\"]\nwget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.7.0.tar.gz\ntar -xzf elasticsearch-1.7.0.tar.gz\n[/code]\n\n\nOther Options: \nnutch-2.3\n, \nhbase-0.94.26\n, \nElasticSearch 1.4\n\n\nSetup HBase\n\n\n\n1\n edit \n$HBASE_ROOT/conf/hbase-site.xml\n and add\n\n\n\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n\n\n    \n\n        \nhbase.rootdir\n\n        \nfile:///full/path/to/where/the/data/should/be/stored\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nhbase.cluster.distributed\n\n        \nfalse\n\n    \n\n\n\n[/code]\n\n\n2\n edit \n$HBASE_ROOT/conf/hbase-env.sh\n and enable \nJAVA_HOME\n and set it to the proper path:\n\n\n\n[code lang=\"diff\"]\n-# export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.6.0/ +export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/\n[/code]\n\n\nThis step might seem redundant, but even with \nJAVA_HOME\n being set in my shell, HBase just didn't recognize it.\n\n\n\n3\n kick off HBase:\n\n\n\n$HBASE_ROOT/bin/start-hbase.sh\n\n\n\n4\n Setting up Nutch\n\n\n\n1\n enable the HBase dependency in\n\n\n\n$NUTCH_ROOT/ivy/ivy.xml\n by uncommenting the line\n\n\n\ndependency org=\"org.apache.gora\" name=\"gora-hbase\" rev=\"0.5\" conf=\"*-\ndefault\" /\n\n\n\n2\n configure the HBase adapter by editing the \n$NUTCH_ROOT/conf/gora.properties\n:\n\n\n\n-#gora.datastore.default=org.apache.gora.mock.store.MockDataStore +gora.datastore.default=org.apache.gora.hbase.store.HBaseStore\n\n\n\n3\n build Nutch\n\n\n\n$ cd $NUTCH_ROOT $ ant clean $ ant runtime\n\n\n\nThis can take a while and creates \n$NUTCH_ROOT/runtime/local\n.\n\n\n\n4\n configure Nutch by editing \n$NUTCH_ROOT/runtime/local/conf/nutch-site.xml\n:\n\n\n\n\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n\n\n    \n\n        \nhttp.agent.name\n\n        \nmycrawlername\n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nhttp.robots.agents\n\n        \nmycrawlername\n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nstorage.data.store.class\n\n        \norg.apache.gora.hbase.store.HBaseStore\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nplugin.includes\n\n        \n\n        \n\n            protocol-httpclient|urlfilter-regex|parse-(text|tika|js)|index-(basic|anchor)|query-(basic|site|url)|response-(json|xml)|summary-basic|scoring-opic|urlnormalizer-(pass|regex|basic)|indexer-elastic\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \ndb.ignore.external.links\n\n        \ntrue\n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nelastic.host\n\n        \nlocalhost\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n[/code]\n\nor you configure Nutch by editing \n$NUTCH_ROOT/runtime/local/conf/nutch-site.xml\n:\n\n\n\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n\n\n    \n\n        \nplugin.includes\n\n        \n\n        \n\n            protocol-http|protocol-httpclient|urlfilter-regex|\nparse-(text|tika|js)|index-(basic|anchor)|query-(basic|site|url)|response-(json|xml)|\nsummary-basic|scoring-opic|urlnormalizer-(pass|regex|basic)|indexer-elastic|\nindex-metadata|index-more\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \ndb.ignore.external.links\n\n        \ntrue\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nelastic.host\n\n  \nlocalhost\n\n  \nThe hostname to send documents to using TransportClient.\n  Either host and port must be defined or cluster.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nelastic.port\n\n  \n9300\n\n  \n\n  The port to connect to using TransportClient.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nelastic.index\n\n  \nnutch\n\n  \n\n  The name of the elasticsearch index.

The core Nutch extension-points are themselves defined in a plugin, the NutchExtensionPoints plugin (they are listed in the NutchExtensionPoints plugin.xml file). Each extension-point defines an interface that must be implemented by the extension. The core extension points are:\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      Point\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Description\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Example\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      IndexWriter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Writes crawled data to a specific indexing backends (Solr, ElasticSearch, a CVS file, etc.).\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      IndexingFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Permits one to add metadata to the indexed fields. All plugins found which implement this extension point are run sequentially on the parse (from javadoc).\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      Parser\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Parser implementations read through fetched documents in order to extract data to be indexed. This is what you need to implement if you want Nutch to be able to parse a new type of content, or extract more data from currently parseable content.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      HtmlParseFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Permits one to add additional metadata to HTML parses (from javadoc).\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      Protocol\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Protocol implementations allow Nutch to use different protocols (ftp, http, etc.) to fetch documents.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      URLFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      URLFilter implementations limit the URLs that Nutch attempts to fetch. The RegexURLFilter distributed with Nutch provides a great deal of control over what URLs Nutch crawls, however if you have very complicated rules about what URLs you want to crawl, you can write your own implementation.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      URLNormalizer\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      Interface used to convert URLs to normal form and optionally perform substitutions.\n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      ScoringFilter\n    \n\n\n    \n\n      A contract defining behavior of scoring plugins.

Additionally we are required to add the various build configurations to build.xml in the plugin directory.\n\n\n\n6.3 Project structure of a plugin\n\n\n[code lang=\"text\"]\nplugin-name\nplugin.xml # file that tells Nutch about the plugin. build.xml # file that tells ant how to build the plugin. ivy.xml # file that describes any dependencies required by the plugin. src org apache nutch indexer uml-meta # source folder URLMetaIndexingFilter.java scoring uml-meta # source folder URLMetaScoringFilter.java test org apache nutch indexer uml-meta # test folder URLMetaIndexingFilterTest.java scoring uml-meta # test folder URLMetaScoringFilterTest.java\n[/code]\n\n\n\n  \nhttp://nutch.apache.org/\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nhttps://sites.google.com/site/nutch1936/home/introduction\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nWeb Crawling with Apache Nutch\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nIntroduction to Nutch, Part 1: Crawling\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nNutch \u2013 How It Works\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nNutch 2.3 + ElasticSearch 1.7 + HBase 0.94 Setup\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nAboutPlugins\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n \n\u21a9\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConfig nutch run intellij\n\n\nCopy file\n\n\n[code]\n copy all the files in the runtime/conf on out/test/apache-Nutch-2.3 and out/production/apache-Nutch-2.3\n[/code]\n\n\nadd these lines to file \n$NUTCH_SRC/out/test/nutch-site.xml\n\n\n[code]\n\n\n   \nplugin.folders\n\n   \n/build/plugins\n\n \n\n[/code]\n\n\nRun nutch in intellij\n\n\n[code]\nRun-\nEdit Configurations...-\nadd path agrs:path to file list links crawler\n[/code]\n\n\nCrawler\n\n\nConferences\n\n\nWeb Search and Data Mining\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\nStatic Crawler\n\n\n\n\nApache Nutch\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Crawler\n\n\n\n\nnutch-selenium\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent Extractor\n\n\n\n\nboilerpipe\n\n\nWeb Content Extraction Through Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\nPriority Crawler\n\n\nSocial Crawler\n\n\nA New Approach to Dynamic Crawler\n\n\nBuild a crawler system for dynamic websites is not easy task. While you can use a web browser automator (like \nselenium\n), or event when you can integrate selenium with nutch (by using \nnutch-selenium\n). These solutions are still hard to develop, hard to test and hard to manage sessions because we still \"translate\" our process to languages (such as java or python)\n\n\nI suppose a new approach for this problem. Instead of using a  web browser automator, we can inject native javascript codes into browser (via extension or add-on).The advantages of this approach is we can easily inject third party libraries (like \njquery\n (for dom selector), \nRun.js\n (for complicated process) and APIs that supported by browsers). And we can take advance of debugging tool and testing framework in javascript world.\n\n\nIf you want to know about more details, feel free to \ncontact me\n.\n\n\nDev Nutch in Intellij\n\n\nReceipts: \nIntellIJ 14\n, \nApache Nutch 2.3\n\n\n1.\n Get Nutch source\n\n\n[code lang=\"shell\"]\nwget http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/nutch/2.3/apache-nutch-2.3-src.tar.gz\ntar -xzf apache-nutch-2.3-src.tar.gz\n[/code]\n\n\n2.\n Import Nutch source in IntellIJ\n\n\n[wonderplugin_slider id=\"1\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n Get Dependencies by Ant\n\n\n[wonderplugin_slider id=\"3\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\n Import Dependencies to IntellIJ\n\n\n[wonderplugin_slider id=\"4\"]\n\n\n\n\n\nNutch Dev\n\n\n1.Intasll java in ubuntu\n\n\n-Downloads java version .zip\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html\n[/code]\n\n\n-Create folder jvm\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n sudo mkdir /usr/lib/jvm/\n[/code]\n\n\n-Cd to folder downloads java version .zip\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n sudo mv jdk1.7.0_x/ /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_x\n[/code]\n\n\n-Run command line\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_x/jre/bin/java 0\n[/code]\n\n\n-Tets version java\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n  java -version\n[/code]\n\n\n2.Intasll ant in ubuntu\n\n\n-Downloads ant\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\nhttp://ant.apache.org/manualdownload.cgi\n[/code]\n\n\n-Add path ant vao file environment\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n sudo nano /etc/environment\n $ANT_ROOT/bin\n[/code]\n\n\n-Run command line\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\nsource /etc/environment\nant -version\n[/code]\n\n\n3.Intasll hbase in ubuntu\n\n\n-Downloads and extract hbase 0.94.27\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n  https://archive.apache.org/dist/hbase/hbase-0.94.27/\n[/code]\n\n\n-Edit file $HABSE_ROOT/conf/hbase-site.xml\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n \n\n  \n\n    \nhbase.rootdir\n\n    \nfile:///$PATH_DATA_BASE/database\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nhbase.cluster.distributed\n\n    \nfalse\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nhbase.zookeeper.quorum\n\n    \nhbase.io\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nzookeeper.znode.parent\n\n    \n/hbase-unsecure\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nhbase.rpc.timeout\n\n    \n2592000000\n\n  \n\n\n\n[/code]\n\n\n-Edit file $HBASE_ROOT/conf/hbase-env.sh\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n  export JAVA_HOME=$PATH_JAVA_HOME\n[/code]\n\n\n-Edit file $HBASE_ROOT/conf/regionservers\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\nhbase.io.nutch\n[/code]\n\n\n-Edit file hosts in ubuntu\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n  sudo nano /etc/hosts\n  {ip} hbase.io.nutch\n[/code]\n\n\n-Edit file hostname in ubuntu\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n sudo nano /etc/hostname\n hbase.io.nutch\n[/code]\n\n\n-Run and stop hbase in ubuntu\n[code]\n Run hbase : cd $HBASE_ROOT/bin ./start-hbase.sh\n Stop hbase: cd $HBASE_ROOT/bin ./stop-hbase.sh\n[/code]\n\n\n*Error in intasll hbase\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n- Error regionserver localhost(Edit file hosts and file host name)\n- Error client no remote server intasll hbase(Turn off file firewall)\n[/code]\n\n\n4.Build nutch in ant\n\n\n-Downloads and extract nutch\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n  http://nutch.apache.org/\n[/code]\n\n\n-Edit file $NUTCH_ROOT/ivy/ivy.xml\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n \n\n\n-Edit file $NUTCH_ROOT/ivy/ivysettings.xml\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n #\n\n\n\n[/code]\n\n\n-Edit file $NUTCH_ROOT/conf/nutch-site.xml\n[code lang=\"xml\"]\n\n\n\n\n   \nplugin.folders\n\n   \n$NUTCH_ROOT/build/plugins\n\n \n\n\n\n        \nhttp.agent.name\n\n        \nmycrawlername\n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nhttp.robots.agents\n\n        \nmycrawlername\n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nstorage.data.store.class\n\n        \norg.apache.gora.hbase.store.HBaseStore\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nplugin.includes\n\n        \n\n        \n\n            protocol-http|protocol-httpclient|urlfilter-regex|parse-(text|tika|js)|index-(basic|anchor)|query-(basic|site|url)|response-(json|xml)|summary-basic|scoring-opic|urlnormalizer-(pass|regex|basic)|indexer-elastic|index-metadata|index-more\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \ndb.ignore.external.links\n\n        \ntrue\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nelastic.host\n\n  \nlocalhost\n\n  \nThe hostname to send documents to using TransportClient.\n  Either host and port must be defined or cluster.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nelastic.port\n\n  \n9300\n\n  \n\n  The port to connect to using TransportClient.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nelastic.index\n\n  \nnutch\n\n  \n\n  The name of the elasticsearch index.

This is what you need to implement if you want Nutch to be able to parse a new type of content, or extract more data from currently parseable content.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      HtmlParseFilter\n     \n\n     \n      Permits one to add additional metadata to HTML parses (from javadoc).\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      Protocol\n     \n\n     \n      Protocol implementations allow Nutch to use different protocols (ftp, http, etc.) to fetch documents.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      URLFilter\n     \n\n     \n      URLFilter implementations limit the URLs that Nutch attempts to fetch. The RegexURLFilter distributed with Nutch provides a great deal of control over what URLs Nutch crawls, however if you have very complicated rules about what URLs you want to crawl, you can write your own implementation.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      URLNormalizer\n     \n\n     \n      Interface used to convert URLs to normal form and optionally perform substitutions.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      ScoringFilter\n     \n\n     \n      A contract defining behavior of scoring plugins. A scoring filter will manipulate scoring variables in CrawlDatum and in resulting search indexes. Filters can be chained in a specific order, to provide multi-stage scoring adjustments.\n     \n\n     \n     \n   \n\n   \n     \n      SegmentMergeFilter\n     \n\n     \n      Interface used to filter segments during segment merge. It allows filtering on more sophisticated criteria than just URLs. In particular it allows filtering based on metadata collected while parsing page.",

While you can use a web browser automator (like  selenium ), or event when you can integrate selenium with nutch (by using  nutch-selenium ). These solutions are still hard to develop, hard to test and hard to manage sessions because we still \"translate\" our process to languages (such as java or python)  I suppose a new approach for this problem. Instead of using a  web browser automator, we can inject native javascript codes into browser (via extension or add-on).The advantages of this approach is we can easily inject third party libraries (like  jquery  (for dom selector),  Run.js  (for complicated process) and APIs that supported by browsers). And we can take advance of debugging tool and testing framework in javascript world.  If you want to know about more details, feel free to  contact me .",

When Would I Use Apache HBase? \n1\n\n\n\nHBase isn\u2019t suitable for every problem.\n\n\nFirst, make sure you have enough data. If you have hundreds of millions or billions of rows, then HBase is a good candidate. If you only have a few thousand/million rows, then using a traditional RDBMS might be a better choice due to the fact that all of your data might wind up on a single node (or two) and the rest of the cluster may be sitting idle.\n\n\nSecond, make sure you can live without all the extra features that an RDBMS provides (e.g., typed columns, secondary indexes, transactions, advanced query languages, etc.) An application built against an RDBMS cannot be \"ported\" to HBase by simply changing a JDBC driver, for example. Consider moving from an RDBMS to HBase as a complete redesign as opposed to a port.\n\n\nThird, make sure you have enough hardware. Even HDFS doesn\u2019t do well with anything less than 5 DataNodes (due to things such as HDFS block replication which has a default of 3), plus a NameNode.\n\n\nHBase can run quite well stand-alone on a laptop - but this should be considered a development configuration only.\n\n\n2. Features \n2\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear and modular scalability.\n\n\nStrictly consistent reads and writes.\n\n\nAutomatic and configurable sharding of tables\n\n\nAutomatic failover support between RegionServers.\n\n\nConvenient base classes for backing Hadoop MapReduce jobs with Apache HBase tables.\n\n\nEasy to use Java API for client access.\n\n\nBlock cache and Bloom Filters for real-time queries.\n\n\nQuery predicate push down via server side Filters\n\n\nThrift gateway and a REST-ful Web service that supports XML, Protobuf, and binary data encoding options\n\n\nExtensible jruby-based (JIRB) shell\n\n\nSupport for exporting metrics via the Hadoop metrics subsystem to files or Ganglia; or via JMX\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

Reading a nested doc is faster than the equivalent parent/child.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Updating a single field in a nested document (parent or nested children) forces ES to reindex the entire nested document. This can be very expensive for large nested docs\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4e \u201cCross referencing\u201d nested documents is impossible\n\n\n\u261b Best suited for data that does not change frequently\n\n\n\n\n\nParent/Child\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Updating a child doc does not affect the parent or any other children, which can potentially save a lot of indexing on large docs\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Children are stored separately from the parent, but are routed to the same shard. So parent/children are slightly less performance on read/query than nested\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Parent/child mappings have a bit extra memory overhead, since ES maintains a \u201cjoin\u201d list in memory\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Sorting/scoring can be difficult with Parent/Child since the Has Child/Has Parent operations can be opaque at times\n\n\n\n\n\nDenormalization\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d You get to manage all the relations yourself!\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Most flexible, most administrative overhead\n\n\n\u261b May be more or less performant depending on your setup\n\n\n\n\n\n4.
